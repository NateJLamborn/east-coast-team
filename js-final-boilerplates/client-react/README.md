Hello! As you run this application, you'll notice that the home page states that there all products are out of stock.

This is because there are none in the database!

To rectify this, you will need to go to the login page and create a user.

Once you have created a user, you will need to manually go to the database and change the admin column from false ( 0 ), to true ( 1 ).

Once you have an admin user, you can login in and see your profile which has three extra buttons which are not available to non-admin users.

You can now click on the "Add Product" button and begin adding products to your database that will automatically display on the home page!

As an admin you can also restock products and check the inventory of products in your inventory. 

Thank you! Future features to come!
